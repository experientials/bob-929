Component selection

- TPS796xx power reg vs RT8272 based on availability (Ti needs fewer components)
- TCA9534 over TCA9554 8-bit to save price. No apparent feature difference
- TCA9535 16-bit is SSOP/TSSOP in stock

## Upwork Job

You will revise my PCB design done with KiCAD v6. I have a schematic and basic PCB layout with the outline.
The board takes two connectors to camera modules and combine them into a single connector adding SD Card slot, I/O Expander, oscilator, voltage regulator and signal voltage translation.
I will want to add an MCU in the future so if you can reserve space for it on the board that will be very helpful.
I need a review for signal interference and quality of high speed signal lanes. I have not tried to route the
PCB, that will be your job.

- Correct design rules according to JLCPCB manufacturing
- Check the correctness of footprints against datasheets
- Check the need for capacitors on board reducing redundant ones
- Check that the schema/board has good ESD/noise reduction circuits
- Place resistors and capacitors where appropriate
- Update/Resolve Design checklist
- Ensure that differential pairs are routed together and balanced correctly
- Add 2 mounting holes next to P3 and P3 (symmetric)
- P3, P4 and P8 are aligned horizontally with overlapping centers
- Route the board

Symbols and footprints are found in https://github.com/experientials/kicad-lib.
